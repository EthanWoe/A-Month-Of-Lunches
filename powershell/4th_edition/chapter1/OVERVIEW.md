# Chapter 1 Review

## Content
* This chapter mainly talked about the history of PowerShell, whether PowerShell is a good fit for the user, and how PowerShell is a powerful automation tool that can save thousands of minutes.

## Assignment
* There was no really given assignment in Chapter 1, so I just made a Windows environment through VirtualBox, as I need more practice in VMs, and to prevent anything from happening to my home environment.
