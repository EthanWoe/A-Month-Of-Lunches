# Day 2 - Installing and Customizing PowerShell

## Overview
Today was another easy day, as all that was required was to download vscode and the PowerShell extension for vscode. There was also getting familiar with the basics of PowerShell 
like pressing tab to find valid parameters for the command that you typed.

## Assignment
Today's assignment was to make sure that vscode was installed, the PowerShell extension in vscode is installed, and to configure vscode to our liking. I did all of these, but I like the normal version of 
vscode, so I just made the font a little bigger.
