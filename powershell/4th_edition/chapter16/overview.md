* Could not do this on my VM cause I kept receiving a message saying permission was denied, but still returned it. It seems after doing deeper research, it is a bug that has not been patched (Source: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10371). I was able to do it on my home machine, though. I looked at the examples of get-service and got ``` process = get-service| Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}```
